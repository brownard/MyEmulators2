Q: Why won't ___ emulator work? (Project 64, ePSXe...)

A: Check this thread for working configs:
   http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/my-emulators-247/emulator-configurations-44459/

   Here are some common settings

   Project 64:
   Uncheck the option "Use quotes in paths".

   ePSXe:
   The Arguments to emulator has to be include these switches 
   at the end (including a space after)
   -nogui -loadbin 
   So it would look like this:
   "-nogui -loadbin " 
   (minus the quotes).

   Gens:
   If you have problems with the GENS emulator starting
   windowed after closing with alt+f4, you could either
   try Gens+ (Gens Plus):
   http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/genesis/gens_plus.html

   or in the gens.cfg file try changing Full Screen=0 to
   Full Screen=1. If it still starts windowed, also set
   gens.cfg to Read-only (this prevents preferences from
   changing).

   Other:
   To pass argments to the emulator, just add them in the
   Arguments to Emulator field, ie -switch1.

   To have switches after the executable, add the widcard
   %ROM% where the path is to be inserted, ie
   -switch1 %ROM% -switch2.

   When a game is launched from the list, the wildcard
   will be replaced by the correct game file. If no %ROM%
   is defined, the path to the game file will be inserted
   at the end.

   You can also set .bat files as emulators if that helps.



Q: Which emulators are the best?

A: The highest rated ones on http://www.emulator-zone.com/



Q: Where can I download system thumbnails?

A: http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/attachments/my-emulators-247/2448d1168379310-my-emulators-emulator_icons.rar



Q: Where can I download thumbnails for games?

A: http://localarcade.com/screenshotarchive/



Q: Where can I find the most recent version of the 
   My Emulators plugin?

A: Download the file myEmulators.rar from:
   https://myemulators.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/myemulators



Q: My system thumbnails won't show up

A: The image should be named exactly the same as the name
   of the emulator in MediaPortal. Supported file types
   are gif, jpg and png. Make sure the images are in one
   of these folders (depending on your system):

   WinXP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\myEmulators\emulators
   Vista: C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\myEmulators\emulators

   Example: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\myEmulators\emulators\N64.jpg

   If you can't see the Application Data folder, go to the
   windows control panel and go into Folder Options, go to
   the View tab and select "Show hidden files and folders".

   For Mediaportal versions before 1.0.0.0
   you can try the thumbs\myEmulators\emulators folder
   in the folder you installed MediaPortal into. Usually:
   C:\Program Files\Team Mediaportal\Mediaportal\thumbs\myEmulators\emulators\

   

Q: My thumbnails for games won't show up

A: Supported file types are gif, jpg and png. Create a
   subfolder named as the emulator in one of these folders
   (depending on your system), and name the image exactly
   the same as the game name in MediaPortal:

   WinXP: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\myEmulators\games
   Vista: C:\ProgramData\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\myEmulators\games

   Example: C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Team MediaPortal\MediaPortal\thumbs\myEmulators\games\N64\1080 Snowboarding.jpg

   If you can't see the Application Data folder, go to the
   windows control panel and go into Folder Options, go to
   the View tab and select "Show hidden files and folders".

   For Mediaportal versions before 1.0.0.0
   you can try the thumbs\myEmulators\games folder in the
   folder you installed MediaPortal into, usually:
   C:\Program Files\Team Mediaportal\Mediaportal\thumbs\myEmulators\games
   with a subdirectory named as the emulator and the image
   named exactly the same as the game name in MediaPortal.



Q: How can I exit every emulator with the same key press?

A: You can go to this site which has a list of emulators
   that have been modified to be closed with the same key
   press (esc):

   http://localarcade.com/screenshotarchive/downloads_emus.htm


   Or you can get one of these programs to map key presses
   to remotes/gamepads and set a button to Alt+F4 to close
   emulators (although it does not work in every situation,
   e.g. ePSXe wont save...):

   JoyToKey (simplest)
      http://www.oneswitch.org.uk/2/I/JoyToKey/JoyToKey.htm

   Xpadder (has many options)
      http://www.xpadder.com/

   ControlMK (pretty simple)
      http://www.redcl0ud.com/controlmk/index.html

   AutoHotkey (uses scripts)
      http://www.autohotkey.com/

   HIP (main purpose is remotes, has small delay)
      http://www.byremote.com.au/HIP/

   Pinnacle Game Profiler (costs money)
      http://www.pinnaclegameprofiler.com/

   Total Game Control (costs money)
      http://www.digitaltransforms.com/

   Notes: ePSXe has to be closed with Esc. If it is closed
   with Alt+F4 it won't save the game and the process will
   still be running.

   In ZSNES if you go into 'Misc' then 'Misc Keys' and click
   'Exit' you can define it as one of your remote/gamepad
   buttons or a custom key. The exit key for ZSNES only
   works when a rom is loaded though, not when ZSNES is just
   sitting idle.

Q: How do I select more than one file type to search for
   in the "Filter for showing files"?

A: Separate with ; Eg: *.nes;*.rom



Q: Can I categorize games into subfolders or browse by
   letter or search for games within MediaPortal?

A: Subdirectories are supported now (v2.5).

   You can search for games in the configuration window,
   on the database tab by pressing Ctrl + F.

   You can not search for games within mediaportal yet.



Q: Can you add support for the ___ skin?

A: You could try asking the creator of that skin or in its
   thread on the Mediaportal forums.

   http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/skins-50/

   Also, if you have made/modified an xml file to work with
   a skin please post it in the My Emulators skin thread:

   http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/my-emulators-247/post-skin-files-here-42074/

   Currently supported skins:
   Blue3
   BlueTwo
   BlueTwo wide
   Project Mayhem 3



Q: How do I add descriptions, ratings or genres or change
   the name of games?

A: In the My Emulators configuration on the Game Database
   tab.



Q: I have a question not answered here

A: Check the readme and search through this thread:
   http://forum.team-mediaportal.com/my-emulators-247/my-emulators-12771/

   If its not in there then make a new post. The author
